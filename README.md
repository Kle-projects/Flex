# Flex
## Introduction
Flex is a Spring Boot based web-application which allows users to track workouts, daily intake, and body weight. Users will also be able to set specific goals for each of the elements that they are able to track and see their progress over time. This will solve the dilemma of needing multiple apps to track your overall fitness by providing one website that allows you to track everything.
